Welcome to my blog!

For a few months now I have been working at [6WIND](http://6wind.com), a
company providing packet processing software and trying to eliminate
performance bottlenecks for physical and virtual Linux applications. In other
words, we sell software that makes computers and routing gear process the
packets way faster. We try to attain the _wirespeed_ limit: if you consider
your Ethernet cable as a pipe, we want to push inside as many bits per second
as this pipe is capable to convey.

I intend to publish here a series of article related to my work. I am lucky
enough to work at a position where I learn a lot; of course, this also means
that I do not master everything, and that my writings can occasionally contain
some mistakes. Or also, things to improve. Or topics of interest for an open
discussion. I did not wish to enable comments directly on this blog, but if you
want to react in any way please feel free to ping by email or via Twitter!

What can you expect to find here? Well…

* We will start with some notions about SDN.
* A series about my current research project, BEBA, should follow.
* Hopefully I will publish some materials about my experiments with eBPF.
* And then we will see what comes next, I have no doubt I will keep working on
  other interesting topics.


Before we begin, here are a few words about the shape of this site. It is
called {{ site.title }}, what could that mean? This is the best I came with
when I searched for a name. “Offload” refers to the transfer of the effort
needed for some task to something else. In particular, this is used at several
levels in fast networking: TCP, or “generic” [segmentation
offload](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_segment_offload) (TSO, GSO,
respectively) can be used to release the CPU from some overhead by appointing
buffer segmentation to the <acronym title="Network Interface
Card">NIC</acronym> instead. Also, most of the packet processing can be
delegated to some hardware <acronym title="1pplication-Specific Integrated
Circuit">ASIC</acronym> or <acronym title="Field-Programmable Gate
Array">FPGA</acronym>. And for the “whirl” part, it can take on several
meanings—less technical, more lyrical maybe: something undergoing a rapid
rotating movement for example, as if we would offload some kind of machinery
with great gears spinning—an artistic view of a packet processing engine?
_Whirl_ also stands for a fast-paced succession of events: or of incoming
packets, maybe? Unless we consider _{{ site.title }}_ as a kind of a swirling
offload… It can take a lot of meanings indeed, so just pick the one that suits
you best! For me, it relates to _whirlwind_, and hence to 6WIND of course.
Well, in a way, writing on this blog is as if we had discharged a small part of
6WIND research onto the web. Kind of…

And what of the logo? At 6WIND we have an established graphical chart, based on
blue (mostly) and orange (a little)—see the company's logo. And we use a
variety of racing cars on marketing presentation or graphics. As far as I know,
they are used to represent speed—as in really, really fast networking. But I am
not really into cars, and since this is not the official blog, let's say I am
free to choose another logo here!

So this is a frigate bird. I hope you like it?
[Frigates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frigatebird) are great in size, with
wings that can span up to two meters. The males of some species have a red
gular pouch they can inflate to attract female birds (this is the red stain on
the logo). We remain in the aerial domain. Frigates can use soaring _winds_ to
fly for a long time above the sea, in which they catch fish. And what's more,
they have a steady and… extremely fast flight. Perfectly appropriate!

Now that we have a name, a logo, and everything needed to create posts, let's
start the serious talks!
